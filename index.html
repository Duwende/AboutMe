    <ul>
        <li>
            Maintained and supported Construction Management & Payments and Material Sampling & Testing
            WPF desktop applications; modifying stored procedures, functions, and data on SQL Server as well as
            Crystal Reports in an MVVM design pattern implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Upgraded local install of Oracle Primavera P6 v6.2.1 by installing Primavera P6 EPPM. Over time I
            installed releases 8.3, 8.4, 15.1 with no oversight and later 17.1 and 19.1 with an outside contractor. My
            contributions ensured that this critical infrastructure continued on a supported version of SQL Server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Architected and developed C# adapter API to simplify integration of other systems with Primavera P6
            Web Services. DOTâ€™s Environmental Application and Bid Letting systems were able to be integrated
            without intimate knowledge of Primaveraâ€™s underlying data structures and provided a vehicle for the
            immediate flow of important data between systems. This was developed before Primavera started using
            LDAP authentication; mapping users between systems utilized SQL Server and code-first Entity
            Framework.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed Checker Maintenance application from written requirements. Wrote code with minimal
            oversight using VB.NET, Win Forms, SQL Server. I provided a method of list maintenance for users
            across several categories reducing wait times by 80%. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed C# program to funnel and validate Lighting Inventory data from an MS Access database to
            SQL Server. Data covered approximately a quarter of the stateâ€™s light poles along highways and
            interstates and included over 25 GB of pictures.
        </li>
        <li>
            Presented, successfully, a proposed Winter Maintenance system at the DOT Regional Meeting, fielding
            questions and taking feedback. I was assigned to alternate projects during the development phase, but
            later returned for maintenance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combined three separately sourced datasets of training, registration, and course data into a single set of
            files for importing to a new central Learning Management System.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a File Director plugin for DOT Finance Office using Visual Basic that resulted in increased
            efficiency and reduced human error with document scanning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rewrote Non State Trunk Road Inventory system to C# and SQL Server, converting it off the mainframe.
